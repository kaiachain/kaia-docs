## Logo Usage Best Practices

The following guidelines ensure the Kaia logo is presented correctly and effectively:

* **Correct Variations:**  Kaia provides various logo versions for different applications. Please select the appropriate version for your specific use case.  The provided asset pack contains all available variations.
* **No Modifications:**  Do not modify or alter the logo in any way. This includes resizing (unless proportionally), changing colors, adding effects, or distorting the original artwork.
* **Placement and Visibility:**  Place the logo prominently and ensure it's clearly visible and unobstructed.  Avoid cluttered backgrounds or placements that make the logo difficult to identify.
* **Attribution:** When using the Kaia logo, please acknowledge the Kaia project and, if possible, link to relevant resources such as the official website or documentation. This helps build community and awareness.
