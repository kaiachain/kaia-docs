# LINE Mini DApp with Unity

## Introduction

LINE serves as a comprehensive communication and lifestyle platform with over 200 million active users. By integrating Web3 capabilities into LINE through mini dApps, developers can leverage LINE's vast user base to facilitate mainstream adoption of blockchain technologies. This integration allows users to interact with decentralized applications directly within their familiar LINE interface, eliminating the need to switch between multiple platforms.

This tutorial guides you through building mini dApps on the LINE platform using Unity WebGL and Kaia's infrastructure. Mini dApps allow developers to integrate Web3 functionality directly into LINE, leveraging its extensive user base.

You will learn how to create a mini dApp that enables users to connect their wallets, check token balances, and mint tokens. This guide caters to both experienced blockchain developers and those new to Web3 development. By the end of this tutorial, you will have the skills to build and deploy your own LINE mini dApp.

## Getting Started

Ready to build your first LINE mini dApp? We'll walk through creating a dApp using Unity WebGL, transform it into a LIFF (LINE Front-end Framework) app, and add some exciting token minting capabilities. If you're unfamiliar with some of these terms, each concept will be explained thoroughly.
