# Smart Contracts

This section covers the development resources for the Smart Contract development.

To write smart contracts, Kaia currently supports [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) as the primary programming language. Solidity is adopted in Kaia because it is a _de facto_ standard contract programming language for Ethereum and has a large user base and an active community. The Kaia team decided to provide the users with familiar development experience so that the Ethereum DApp developers could easily experiment with or migrate their existing smart contracts to Kaia.

In the future, Kaia also plans to support writing smart contracts using other programming languages. The Kaia team is investigating various favorable programming languages that developers might embrace.
