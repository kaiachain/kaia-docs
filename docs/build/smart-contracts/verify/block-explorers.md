# How to verify Smart Contracts Using Block Explorers

## Introduction

Usually, the deployer of a smart contract is the only party with access to the code that was actually deployed, and the public cannot read the source code of a contract until the deployer has verified it. However, this is where contract verification comes in as an important step in the smart-contract development cycle, as it helps improve the transparency (for users), convenience (for developers), and security of deployed contracts.

Having said that, once a smart contract is validated, block explorers like Kaiascan and OKX Kaia Explorer also make it possible for the public to interact with the contract's public methods using the block explorer's user interface. This is in addition to the public having direct access to the verified contract source code.
 
In this guide, we'll take a look at how to use block explorers to verify deployed smart contracts on the Kaia Network.

## Prerequisites

* [Remix IDE](https://ide.kaia.io/) and [Kaia Wallet](https://docs.kaiawallet.io/getting_started/quick_start#install-kaia-wallet)
* Enough test KAIA from [faucet](https://faucet.kaia.io)

## Getting Started

In this guide, we will be going over verifying both single contracts and multi-part contracts on the block explorer that exists in the Kaia ecosystem, viz.:

* [Kaiascan](https://www.kaiascan.io/)
* [OKLink](https://www.oklink.com/kaia)

Without further ado, let's get started!

## Deploying a single Contract

To verify a smart contract, you need to deploy the contract first on the target network. Hence, for the sake of this guide, we will be deploying the contract to Kaia Kairos Testnet. Also, in this tutorial, we will be deploying a simple counter contract named `Counter.sol` on Remix IDE. The code is shown below: 

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
contract Counter {
    uint256 public count;
    constructor(uint256 _initialCount) {
        count = _initialCount;
    }
    function incrementCounter() public {
        count++;
    }
    function decrementCounter() public {
        count--;
    }
    function resetCounter() public {
        count = 0;
    }
}
``` 

:::note

You can check this page for a tutorial on deploying smart contracts using [libraries](../../../references/sdk/sdk.md) on Kaia Kairos Testnet. You may also use a developer tool such as [Hardhat](../../get-started/hardhat.md), [Foundry](../deploy/foundry.md), [Remix](../deploy/deploy.md#remix-ide)  or another tool if preferred, to deploy the smart contract to Kaia Kairos Testnet.

## Parameters for single contract verification

Verifying a contract on the block explorers requires some parameters, and these must be considered while deploying the smart contract. The following are some details related to the contract's compiler and deployment in order to verify a contract successfully: 

Remix IDE :

* On Remix IDE, navigate to the **Solidity compiler tab**.
  * Observe the **compiler version** used to compile and deploy the contract.
  * Observe the **Open Source License Type** used in the contract. This means the SPDX license identifier used at the beginning of the Solidity source file. In the `Counter.sol` file we used `// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT`
  * Observe the **EVM version** used for deploying contracts.
  * (Optional) If **optimization** is enabled during compilation, take note of the value of the optimization runs parameter

* On Remix IDE, navigate to **Kaia tab**.
  * (Optional) If the contract constructor method accepts arguments, take note of the [ABI-encoded form](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) of the constructor arguments
  * Take note of the contract address of the smart contract on the **Deployed Contracts** tab after successful deployment.

## Deploying a multi-part contract

It is important to note that deploying a multi-part contract involves the same steps as deploying a single contract. For the sake of this guide, we will be deploying a simple KIP7 airdrop contract named `airdropToken.sol`. The code is shown below:
 
```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
import "@kaiachain/contracts/KIP/token/KIP7/KIP7.sol";
import "@kaiachain/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
// the creator of the project mints certian amount of fungible tokens directly to a certain selection of wallets.
contract TokenAirdrop is KIP7, Ownable {
    constructor() KIP7("Token Aidrop Demo", "TAD") {
    }
    // Airdrop Token
    function airdropTokens(address[] calldata wAddresses, uint[] calldata tAmount) public onlyOwner {
        require(wAddresses.length == tAmount.length, "Must be same lenght");
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < wAddresses.length; i++) {
            _mintSingleTokens(wAddresses[i], tAmount[i]);
        }
    }
    function _mintSingleTokens(address wAddress, uint amount) private {
        _mint(wAddress, amount);
    }
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
        public
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        return
            super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
}
```

## Parameters for multi-part contract verification

The parameters for verifying a multi-part contract are the same as those for a single contract. However, because they are made up of multiple dependent contracts, we need to pre-process all dependencies of the contract into a single solidity file. This preprocessing is usually referred to as smart contract flattening. 

For this reason, we will have to flatten the contract so it can be verified using the new flattened Solidity file on the block explorer.

Remix IDE:

* On Remix IDE, navigate to the **File explorer tab**.
  * Select the newly created contract under the **contracts** folder
  * Click or tap with two fingers to see all commands available on the contract. 
  * Select **flatten**

  * Once the code is flattened, you will see a new contract named `airdropTokens_flattened.sol`.

:::note

There are different tools for flattening a multi-part smart contract into a single Solidity file, such as [Hardhat Flattener](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/advanced/flattening). Kindly refer to the respective smart contract flattening tool's documentation for more detailed instructions on its usage.

#### Verifying single contract

1. Fill in the **contract address** for the deployed contract (Counter.sol)
2. Select the **compiler version** used for the `Counter.sol` example
3. Select the **Open Source License Type** used for the `Counter.sol` example. For `Counter.sol` example, select the option, **MIT License (MIT)**. If there was none used, select **No License (None)**
4. Make sure to download `Counter.sol` from Remix IDE and upload it in the **Source Code (Solidity File)** field
5. Select the **EVM version** for the contract. For `Counter.sol` example, select the option **Istanbul**.
6. Select **True** for **Optimization** if it was enabled during compilation, and fill in the number of runs under **Optimization Runs** to be **200**.
7. (optional) To get the ABI-encoded constructor arguments for this field, navigate to [abi.hashex.org](http://abi.hashex.org) to get the encoded data following the image below:
