## PC web browser based decentralized HD wallet

Kaia Wallet is a web browser extension available in Chrome. Kaia Wallet is optimized for the desktop environment.

Kaia Wallet offers manageability of user accounts and keys. All transactions are transparently recorded on the Kaia blockchain, so anybody can access the transaction history by using [KaiaScan](../block-explorers/kaiascan.md).

Kaia Wallet is a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet, meaning that it generates a hierarchical tree-like structure of private/public keys indefinitely from a single seed phrase. The seed phrase consists of mnemonic code words, which makes it easier to remember than phrases made of random alphanumerics. Users' private keys are encrypted and stored in their browsers.

With the features described above, Kaia Wallet has improved the security, transparency, and user-friendliness of the current blockchain experience. However, it is vital for users to be responsible for managing their personal accounts. For example, if a user couldn't remember his/her seed phrase, there would be no other way to restore his/her accounts.

## Supporting various Kaia networks and tokens

Kaia Wallet allows you to store and transact with all Kaia-based tokens including KAIA. Tokens that are not loaded by default can be inserted by pasting in their contract address. You can even store and transact your own Kaia-based custom tokens on Kaia Wallet!

Kaia Wallet supports Kaia's Kairos testnet as well as the Mainnet. Moreover, Kaia Wallet supports the private chains for Kaia-based dApp developers who may wish to circulate custom tokens in their private network.

## Signing web-based dApp transactions

Kaia Wallet simply bridges the gap between you and dApps, empowering you to sign transactions/data flowing to you from dApps with Kaia Wallet account.
Kaia Wallet is also an aidful utility for developers to handle [fee-delegated transactions](../../transactions/transactions.md#fee-delegation). Using Kaia Wallet, both transaction senders and fee payers can swiftly sign the fee-delegated transactions.
