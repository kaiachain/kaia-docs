# Use Kaia Safe

## Create a Safe

Here you will see how to create a Safe and evaluate its benefits on the Kaia Network.

**Step 1:** Navigate to [Kaia Safe App](https://safe.kaia.io/). By navigating to the application on your web browser, you can explore the functionality of Kaia Safe.

**Step 2:** Connect your [wallet](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/wallets/intro-to-ethereum-wallets/). At the moment, Kaia Safe support various wallets like [Kaia Wallet](https://docs.kaiawallet.io/), [MetaMask](../../../tutorials/connecting-metamask.mdx) wallet, etc. 

For the sake of this guide, we will be using MetaMask. Make sure you have Kaia networks([Mainnet](../../../tutorials/connecting-metamask.mdx#connect-to-kaia-network) or [Kairos Testnet](../../../tutorials/connecting-metamask.mdx#connect-to-kaia-network)) added to your MetaMask wallet to connect successfully.

**Step 3:**  Once your wallet is connected, click **Create Account** and give your new Safe a **name**. This name is linked to your safe account, which is a multi-signature wallet that holds and stores all of your funds.

**Step 4:** Add owners/signers by inputting the addresses that have permission to submit and approve transactions. You can add as many signers as you want and remove or replace any of them at any time.

**Step 5:** Choose how many signer confirmations a transaction in your Safe account needs to be approved. It is important to note that by default our app allows one signer confirmation. But it is advisable to use a threshold higher than 1 to ensure a secured safe account. Good practice is to use a threshold of 51% of the total owners e.g, 2 out of 3, 3 out of 5 etc as shown below:

**Step 6:** Review and deploy Safe

Once you are completely satisfied with all of your Safe parameters, you can submit the creation of your Safe account and proceed with the on-screen instructions to complete the account creation.

## Further Notes <a id="Points to Note"></a>

The following are things you will want to keep in mind while using Kaia Safe:

### Transaction Fees <a id="Transaction Fees"></a>

Kaia Safe transactions, whether asset transfers or contract interactions, incur a fee that will be paid by the signer that executes the transaction (usually the last signer to reach the required threshold of signatures).

### Safe Nonce <a id="Safe Nonce"></a>

For security reasons, transactions made with Safe need to be executed in order. To achieve this, a number called **nonce** is assigned to a transaction to ensure that each transaction can be executed once. 

![](/img/build/tools/kaia-safe/ks-nounce.png)

At any given time, only transactions with a nonce _last executed transaction +1_ can be executed. Transactions with a higher nonce are queued for execution. So, whenever a transaction is completed, the next transaction in the queue is made available for execution, provided it has accumulated enough signatures.

### Chain-specific addresses <a id="Chain-specific addresses"></a>

You can choose to copy address with chain prefix

* Copy addresses with chain prefix:

When copying your safe address from your dashboard to paste in your wallet as seen above, you can either choose to add the chain name or not by clicking the checkbox. It is suggested that you leave it unchecked to avoid the error below.
