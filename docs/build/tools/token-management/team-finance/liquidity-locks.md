# Liquidity Locks

## Introduction
Locking liquidity ensures that liquidity provider (LP) tokens cannot be withdrawn from a liquidity pool for a set duration. This is done by transferring the LP tokens to a time-locked smart contract, typically using services like Team Finance.  

With liquidity locking, token holders can define specific timeframes for unlocking their funds, create multiple locks with different owner addresses and expiration dates, or transfer lock ownership to another wallet. During the lock period, token holders are restricted from accessing their locked tokens.  

When the lock period ends, token holders can reclaim their LP tokens through the 'Claims' dashboard. These tokens can then be exchanged for the paired tokens in the liquidity pool on decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap (e.g., SWAP/ETH).  

Liquidity pools consist of token reserves secured in smart contracts, enabling decentralized trading and ensuring market liquidity for users on DEX platforms.
