# Kaia Online Toolkit

## What is the Kaia Online Toolkit? <a id="what-is-the-kaia-online-toolkit"></a>

* `Kaia Online Toolkit` provides code examples to help you to utilize the `Kaia SDK(caver-js)` easily. Also it provides a [demo page](https://toolkit.klaytn.foundation) for developers to use simple online tools.
* `Kaia SDK(caver-js)` is a JavaScript API library that allows developers to interact with a Kaia node using an HTTP or Websocket connection.
* You can just try out Kaia's features without having to code.

> To help more people use the `Kaia Online Toolkit`, We have prepared the ["Using Kaia Online Toolkit"](https://medium.com/klaytn/using-klaytn-online-toolkit-1-multisig-60399a0b0278) series.
