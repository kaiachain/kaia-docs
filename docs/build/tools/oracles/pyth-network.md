# Pyth Network

![](/img/banners/kaia-pyth.png)

## Overview

The [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/) is one of the largest first-party Oracle network, delivering real-time data across [a vast number of chains](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/contract-addresses).

The network comprises some of the world’s [largest exchanges, market makers, and financial services providers](https://pyth.network/publishers). These publish proprietary data on-chain for aggregation and distribution to smart contract applications. 

## Using Pyth Network

The Pyth introduces an innovative low-latency [pull oracle design](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/on-demand), where users can pull price updates onchain when needed, enabling everyone in the onchain environment to access that data point most efficiently. Pyth network updates the prices every **400ms**, making Pyth one of the fastest on-chain oracles.

Developers on Kaia have permissionless access to any of [Pyth’s price feeds](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) for equities, ETFs, commodities, foreign exchange pairs, and cryptocurrencies.

Here is a working example of a contract that fetches the latest price of ETH/USD on the Kaia network.
You have to pass [Pyth's contract address](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/contract-addresses/evm) for Kaia mainnet/testnet and the desired [price feed id](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) to fetch the latest price.

        bytes[] calldata updateData,
        bytes32 priceFeed
    ) public payable returns (int64) {
		    // Fetch the priceUpdate from hermes.
        uint updateFee = pyth.getUpdateFee(updateData);
        pyth.updatePriceFeeds{value: updateFee}(updateData);

        // Fetch the latest price
        PythStructs.Price memory price = pyth.getPrice(priceFeed);
        return price.price;
    }
}
```

Here you can fetch the `updateData` from our [`Hermes`](https://hermes.pyth.network/docs/), which listens to Pythnet and Wormhole for price updates; or you can use the [`pyth-evm-js`](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/js/src/EvmPriceServiceConnection.ts#L15) SDK. Check [How to Fetch Price Updates](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/fetch-price-updates) to pull the latest data. 

This [package](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity) provides utilities for consuming prices from the Pyth network oracle using Solidity. Also, it contains the [Pyth Interface ABI](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/blob/main/target_chains/ethereum/sdk/solidity/abis/IPyth.json) that you can use in your libraries to communicate with the Pyth contract.

We recommend following the [consumer best practices](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/pythnet-price-feeds/best-practices) when consuming Pyth data.

For more information, check out the official [Pyth documentation](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds). There are details on the various functions available for interacting with the Pyth smart contract in the [API Reference section](https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm/getPrice).

## Pyth on Kaia

The Pyth Network smart contract is available at the following address:

Additionally, click to access the [Pyth price-feed IDs](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids).

## Using Pyth as a PUSH Oracle

Pyth Oracle can be used as a Push oracle by running a scheduler which can update the prices in the backend. It will make sure that the your dapp will be updated with latest prices as per your configuration. Checkout the open source [price pusher](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/apps/price_pusher) app to get started with the scheduler.

## Developers and community

The Pyth network provides additional tools to developers, such as [TradingView Integration](https://docs.pyth.network/guides/how-to-create-tradingview-charts), or the [Gelato web3 functions](https://docs.pyth.network/guides/how-to-schedule-price-updates-with-gelato).
