# SubQuery Multi-Chain Indexer

SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer that provides developers with fast, flexible, universal, open source and decentralized APIs for web3 projects. The SubQuery SDK allows developers to get rich indexed data and build intuitive and immersive decentralized applications in a faster and more efficient way. SubQuery supports 100+ ecosystems including Kaia's EVM, Cosmos, Ethereum, Polygon, Polkadot, Algorand, NEAR, and Avalanche.

Another one of SubQuery's competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data not only within a chain but across multiple blockchains all within a single project. This allows the creation of feature-rich dashboard analytics or multi-chain block scanners.

Other advantages include superior performance with multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities and a configurable caching architecture. To find out more, visit our [documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/).

## Getting started

Take a look at this [SubQuery Starter Project](https://github.com/subquery/ethereum-subql-starter/tree/main/Kaia/klaytn-starter) that introduces SubQuery's Kaia support by indexing all transfers and approval events from the Orbit ETH on Kaia Network .

You can also follow along this [step by step guide](https://academy.subquery.network/quickstart/quickstart.html) to get familiar with SubQuery or check out the [Kaia x SubQuery workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40R5O1kL3v4) to see an actual demo.

## Running and Hosting your Kaia SubQuery APIs

SubQuery is open-source, meaning you have the freedom to run it in the following three ways:

* Locally on your own computer, or a cloud provider of your choosing. View the instructions on how to run SubQuery locally [here](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html).

You can publish it to SubQuery's enterprise-level [Managed Service](https://managedservice.subquery.network/login), where we'll host your SubQuery project in production ready services for mission critical data with zero-downtime blue/green deployments. There even is a generous free tier. [Find out how](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/publish.html).

You can publish it to the decentralized SubQuery Network, the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers. The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way and supports Kaia from launch.
