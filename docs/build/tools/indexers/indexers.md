# Indexers

Blockchain indexers are tools used in the context of blockchain technology to improve the efficiency and speed of searching, querying, and accessing data stored on a blockchain. They create and maintain organized databases of the blockchain's data, allowing users to quickly retrieve information without needing to process the entire blockchain from scratch.

The following providers have integrated with Kaia to deliver blockchain indexing services:

* [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/)
* [SubQuery Network](https://academy.subquery.network/)
