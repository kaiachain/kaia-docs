Cross-chain interoperability protocols are designed to connect blockchain networks that were originally isolated and independent. These protocols enable different chains to interact, allowing for the movement of liquidity and state between them. By establishing rules and processes for transferring assets and data across different blockchain networks, cross-chain interoperability protocols facilitate seamless collaboration and exchange of information between otherwise separate systems.

## Broad Scope of Cross-Chain Solutions <a id="broad-scope-of-cross-chain-solution"></a>

Cross-chain interoperability is a comprehensive concept encompassing various technologies:

1. **Cross-Chain Messaging Protocols**: These enable broad interoperability, supporting diverse operations such as data exchange and cross-chain smart contract execution.

2. **Cross-Chain Bridges**: A specific subset of cross-chain solutions, bridges focus primarily on asset transfer between chains. They play a crucial role in connecting assets across the different blockchain ecosystems but have a more specialized function compared to general messaging protocols.
