# Wormhole

## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

[Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/docs/) is an interoperability platform powering multi chain apps and bridges. It currently has support for 30+ chains including Kaia. By integrating wormhole, a Kaia application can make any token natively multichain, pull any on-chain data on-demand and build custom multi chain protocols. 

## Usage <a id="usage"></a>

Wormhole supports both  [Kaia Mainnet](https://wormhole.com/docs/build/start-building/supported-networks/evm/#__tabbed_34_1) and [Kairos Testnet](https://wormhole.com/docs/build/start-building/supported-networks/evm/#__tabbed_35_1). To get started using Wormhole on Kaia, refer to the following guides:
