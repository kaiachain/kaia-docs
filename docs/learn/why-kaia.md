# Why Build on Kaia

Kaia Blockchain aims to become Asia's #1 blockchain, leading the adoption of Web3 by providing a robust infrastructure for projects of all sizes. This document explains how Kaia is different based on its key design principles and value propositions.

## Wide User Base

1. **Web2 User Accessibility**: Kaia provides easy access to existing Web2 users through messenger-integrated wallets, collaborating with Kakao (50 million Korean users) and LINE (200 million users in Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand).

2. **Web3 User Accessibility**: Kaia offers more than 1.2 million active wallet addresses and interfaces connecting users to projects, facilitating quick attraction of Web3 users.

3. **Community Building Support**: Joint marketing with Kaia Foundation helps users gather and build projects, providing an environment with easy access for users from various chains.

## Abundant Liquidity Support

1. **Real World Asset (RWA) Linkage**: Kaia Blockchain hosts various real-world assets like gold, ships, and real estate. Future plans include on-chaining fiat-backed stablecoins and bonds, expanding the range of assets available to developers.

2. **Large-Scale Ecosystem Fund**: The Kaia Ecosystem Fund, based on KAIA tokens, supports various sectors requiring liquidity, such as DeFi and GameFi.

3. **Chain Native Yield**: Built-in MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) extraction allows KAIA Stakers to automatically earn MEV profits, increasing chain liquidity and providing a token burning mechanism.

## Top-Level Core Technology and Development Convenience

1. **High Performance**:
   - Main chain handles at least 4,000 TPS with immediate transaction finality and one-second block generation time.
   - Scalability through customizable and easily deployable [Service Chains](scaling-solutions.md#service-chain) as <LinkWithTooltip tooltip="L2 (layer 2) blockchains act as an additional<br />  layer that helps the main blockchain handle<br />  more transactions more efficiently.">L2</LinkWithTooltip> solutions.

2. **Ethereum Compatibility**:
   - 100% compatibility ensures EVM-based dApps can be onboarded without modifications.
   - Development tools, EVM, and APIs are equivalent to Ethereum, allowing seamless integration and mutual benefit to both ecosystems. See [Solidity-Smart Contract Language](../build/smart-contracts/fundamentals/solidity-smart-contract-language.md), and [Migrating Ethereum App to Kaia](../build/tutorials/migrating-ethereum-app-to-kaia.mdx).

3. **Convenient Account Model**: Enables assigning various keys to accounts, strengthening security and improving user experience.

4. **Permissionless and Decentralized Structure**: Kaia is transitioning to a permissionless validator structure, increasing network decentralization.

## Low Cost and Enhanced User Experience

1. **Affordable Transaction Fees**: End-users are not burdened with high transaction fees. Costs are stable and determined by transaction complexity. See [Affordable Smart Contract Execution Cost](./smart-contracts/smart-contracts.md#benefits-of-smart-contracts-on-kaia) and [Transaction Fees](transaction-fees/transaction-fees.md).

2. **Fee Delegation**: Applications can cover users' transaction fees, allowing for flexible business models and lowering user acquisition barriers.

## Open-Source Infrastructure and Ecosystem Support

1. **Primary Infrastructure**: Includes SDKs, smart contract libraries, wallets, chain explorers, distributed storage solutions, Oracle support, and bridges.

2. **Secondary Infrastructure**: Ecosystem for supporting products and services, including integration services, stablecoin integrations, DAOs, NFT marketplaces, DEX, DeFi, and traditional finance interfaces.

3. **Ecosystem Fund**: 50% of newly minted tokens are reinvested in the ecosystem through [Kaia Ecosystem Fund](./token-economics/token-economy.md#kaia-ecosystem-fund) and [Kaia Infrastructure Fund](./token-economics/token-economy.md#kaia-infrastructure-fund).

## Community Co-Building and Governance

1. **Diverse Community Engagement**: Kaia expands its ecosystem through collaboration with game guilds, investment DAOs, community DAOs, and global alliances.

2. **Decentralized Governance**: The Kaia Governance Council (GC) includes traditional enterprises, DAOs, and builders, creating a unique governance structure with hundreds of participants.

In summary, Kaia maintains blockchain's core characteristics of transparency, security, and decentralization while providing these enhancements. The protocol remains stable with strongly committed stakeholders, creating an ideal environment for builders to bring innovative Web3 ideas to life.
