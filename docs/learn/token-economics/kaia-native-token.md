## KAIA <a id="klay"></a>

KAIA is the main internal transferable cryptocurrency of Kaia and is used to pay transaction fees when creating or executing smart contracts or when transferring KAIA.

KAIA is a necessary element--a fuel--for operating the Kaia distributed application platform. It is a form of payment made by the clients of the platform to the consensus nodes \(CNs\) executing the requested operations. To put it another way, KAIA is an incentive; it ensures that developers write high-quality applications \(wasteful code costs more\) and that the network remains healthy \(CNs are compensated for the resources they contribute\).
