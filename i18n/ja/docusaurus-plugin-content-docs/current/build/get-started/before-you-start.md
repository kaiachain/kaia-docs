# Before You Start

**Klaytn Networks**

- Baobab testnet
- Cypress mainnet

**Endpoint Node**

- Your [Endpoint Node](../../nodes/endpoint-node/endpoint-node.md) is needed to connect to the Klaytn network and to issue an API call or send a transaction.
- `ken` is a Klaytn Endpoint Node binary. `ken` exposes two interfaces, a [command-line interface](../../nodes/endpoint-node/ken-cli-commands.md) and the [JSON-RPC APIs](../../../references/json-rpc/klay/account-created). `ken` runs on Linux and MacOS.
- `ken` CLI comes with several utility and node management functions.
