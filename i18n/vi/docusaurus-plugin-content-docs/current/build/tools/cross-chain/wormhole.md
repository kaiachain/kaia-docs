# Wormhole

## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

[Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/docs/) is an interoperability platform powering multi chain apps and bridges. It currently has support for 30+ chains including Kaia. By integrating wormhole, a Kaia application can make any token natively multichain, pull any on-chain data on-demand and build custom multi chain protocols.
