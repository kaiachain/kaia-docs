## Introduction <a id="introduction"></a>

[Stargate](https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/v2-developer-docs) is the first fully composable native asset bridge, and the first dApp built on LayerZero. The core of Stargate is to make cross-chain liquidity transfer a seamless, single transaction process. With Stargate, users can swap native assets cross-chain within a single transaction. Meaning that you can swap ETH for KAIA in a single transaction.
