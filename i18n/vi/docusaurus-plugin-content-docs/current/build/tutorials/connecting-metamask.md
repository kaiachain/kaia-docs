# Connect MetaMask to Kaia

![](/img/banners/kaia-metamask.png)

> **Note**: MetaMask is mostly used as a wallet for Ethereum, but it is also compatible with Kaia due to the identical address structures. Kaia also has a browser extension wallet called [Kaikas](../tools/wallets/kaikas.md), so it basically provides the same features as MetaMask, except for Remix.

## Step 1. Install MetaMask <a href="#install-metamask" id="install-metamask"></a>

- We will be using Chrome browser in this example. ([**Install Chrome**](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/))
- Add [**MetaMask Extension**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en) to Chrome.

  > **Note:** You may need additional installations if you are using another browser.
- You can start MetaMask by clicking on the icon in the upper right-hand corner of your chrome browser.

## Step 2. Generate a MetaMask Wallet <a href="#generate-a-metamask" id="generate-a-metamask"></a>

![Create a Wallet](/img/build/tutorials/new-to-metamask.png)

- Click on \[Create a Wallet].
- Set a password.
- You will be given a 12 word seed phrase; back it up somewhere secure.

  > **Note:** You can only restore your wallet with the seed phrase. Sharing your seed phrase with others may result in losing all of your funds. Therefore, it is recommended that you either write it down manually or store it in an offline device.

## Step 3. Connect to Kaia Mainnet <a href="#connect-to-kaia-mainnet" id="connect-to-kaia-mainnet"></a>

> Here's a simple way. [Connect your wallet to the Kaia Mainnet](https://chainlist.org/chain/8217).

- Click on the upper Networks tab, which is on Ethereum Mainnet as default, and select \[Add network].
- Enter the Endpoint Node (EN) data of the Kaia chain.

### Mainnet Configuration

| Network Config Item | Value                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Network Name        | Kaia Mainnet                           |
| New RPC URL         | `https://public-en-cypress.klaytn.net` |
| Block Explorer URL  | `https://kaiascope.com/`               |
| Chain ID            | 8217                                   |
| Currency Symbol     | KAIA                                   |

- Click \[Save] to add Kaia Mainnet.

## Step 4. Send KAIA <a href="#send-klay" id="send-klay"></a>

**Note:** The following steps require KAIA.

- Click \[Send] on the main page and enter the recipient address and the amount of KAIA.

![Send KAIA 1](/img/build/tutorials/metamask-send-klay-1.png)

**NOTE:** Sending KAIA requires a transaction, for which you need KAIA.

- Since Kaia v1.9.0, a [dynamic gas fee mechanism](https://medium.com/klaytn/dynamic-gas-fee-pricing-mechanism-1dac83d2689) has replaced the existing fixed price policy.
- So you don't have to set the fixed gas fee manually.
- Check the amount to send and the transaction fee and click \[Confirm] to complete the KAIA transfer, after which you will be redirected to the main page.
- Click \[Activity] on the main page to confirm the transaction history.

## Connect to Kaia Kairos Network (Testnet) <a href="#connect-to-kaia-kairos-network-testnet" id="connect-to-kaia-kairos-network-testnet"></a>

### Obtain KAIA to make a transaction

> **Note:** This tutorial uses Public EN of the Testnet (Kairos) to connect to the network. Make sure to use Kairos when you are running a test.

> Here's a simple way. [Connect your wallet to the Kaia Kairos Network (Testnet)](https://chainlist.org/chain/1001).

### Kairos Network Configuration

| Network Config Item | Value                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Network Name        | Kaia Kairos                             |
| New RPC URL         | `https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io` |
| Block Explorer URL  | `https://baobab.klaytnscope.com `       |
| Chain ID            | 1001                                    |
| Currency Symbol     | KAIA                                    |

- Click \[Save] to add Kaia Kairos Network.

![Network Setup](/img/build/tutorials/connect-testnet-1.png)

- To test the connection of the Kaia Wallet, you will need to make a transaction, which requires KAIA.
- Click on the kebab menu (three dots) in the upper right corner and select \[Account details].
- Click \[Export Private Key] to obtain your private key.

- When using Kairos Testnet, you can obtain Test Kaia in [**Kaia Faucet**](https://baobab.wallet.klaytn.foundation/access?next=faucet).
- Enter your private key on Kaia Wallet and log in by clicking \[Access]. (Attach 0x in front of the private key.)
- Click \[Run Faucet]. 150 Testnet KAIA will be sent to your account and the balance will be updated accordingly. You can claim Testnet KAIA from Faucet once every 24 hours per account.
