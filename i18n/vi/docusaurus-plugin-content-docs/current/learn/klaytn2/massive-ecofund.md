# Massive Eco Fund

## Our Full-suite, Protocol-level $1B+ Eco Fund <a id="our-full-suite-protocol-level-eco-fund"></a>

Kaia is the first and the largest example in which the incentives supporting the ecosystem are encoded in an on-chain protocol tokenomics. 66% of the newly minted tokens are reinvested in the ecosystem.

Initially issued reserve tokens will also be used as a resource for investment in the ecosystem expansion.

## Grant <a id="grant"></a>

Kaia currently runs two major grant programs which are:

- [Kaia Ecosystem Fund (KEF)](../token-economy.md#kaia-ecosystem-fund)
- [Kaia Infrastructure Fund (KIF)](../token-economy.md#kaia-infrastructure-fund).

## Reward <a id="reward"></a>

Kaia offers rewards to builders of smart contracts that contribute to the growth of on-chain activities on Kaia networks. These rewards are distributed through the Kaia Infrastructure Fund (KIF).
