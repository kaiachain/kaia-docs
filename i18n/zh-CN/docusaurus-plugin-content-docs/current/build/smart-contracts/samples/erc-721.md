# ERC-721

## 导言<a id="introduction"></a>

本教程可帮助您创建一个符合[Kaia 令牌标准](../token-standard.md)，尤其是[不可篡改令牌标准（ERC-721）](../token-standard.md#non-fungible-token-standard-kip-17)的ERC-721兼容令牌示例。

[ERC-721不可封代币标准](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) 定义了以下三个事件和 10 种方法。 ERC-721 的 `supportsInterface` 源自 [ERC-165 标准接口检测](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165)，ERC-165 是 ERC-721 的一部分。
ERC-721兼容代币是实施ERC-721和ERC-165接口的代币合约，具体如下。

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);

function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256);
function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data) external payable;
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external payable;
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;
function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address);
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool);
```

在上述界面的基础上，开发人员可以通过添加新功能和逻辑来定制令牌，并将其部署到 Kaia 网络上。
更多信息，请参阅官方[ERC-721 规范](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)。

在本教程中，您将实现 "MyERC721Card.sol"，它将实现一种卡片类型的不可篡改令牌，即 "MyERC721Card"，它是一种ERC-721令牌。
每张 "MyERC721Card "都有名称和级别，例如 "King"（国王）的级别为 1，"Queen"（王后）的级别为 1。

MyERC721Card.sol "基于 OpenZeppelin 的 ERC721 实现。 本教程的大部分代码来自 OpenZeppelin 2.3
。

### 1.2 看看重要的方法<a id="1-2-take-a-look-at-important-methods"></a>

让我们来详细了解一些重要的方法。

#### \(1\)ERC721的 "构造函数 "和"_INTERFACE_ID_ERC721"。<a id="1-constructor-of-erc721-and-_interface_id_erc721"></a>

constructor "会注册"_INTERFACE_ID_ERC721"，这是一个从 ERC-721 接口导出的 4 字节哈希值，如下所示。

```text
    /*
     *     bytes4(keccak256('balanceOf(address)')) == 0x70a08231
     *     bytes4(keccak256('ownerOf(uint256)')) == 0x6352211e
     *     bytes4(keccak256('approve(address,uint256)')) == 0x095ea7b3
     *     bytes4(keccak256('getApproved(uint256)')) == 0x081812fc
     *     bytes4(keccak256('setApprovalForAll(address,bool)')) == 0xa22cb465
     *     bytes4(keccak256('isApprovedForAll(address,address)')) == 0xe985e9c
     *     bytes4(keccak256('transferFrom(address,address,uint256)')) == 0x23b872dd
     *     bytes4(keccak256('safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)')) == 0x42842e0e
     *     bytes4(keccak256('safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256,bytes)')) == 0xb88d4fde
     *
     *     => 0x70a08231 ^ 0x6352211e ^ 0x095ea7b3 ^ 0x081812fc ^
     *        0xa22cb465 ^ 0xe985e9c ^ 0x23b872dd ^ 0x42842e0e ^ 0xb88d4fde == 0x80ac58cd
     */
    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    constructor () public {
        // register the supported interfaces to conform to ERC721 via ERC165
        _registerInterface(_INTERFACE_ID_ERC721);
    }
```

注册后，当调用 `_INTERFACE_ID_ERC721` 时，ERC-721 和 ERC-165 的 `supportsInterface` 接口会返回 `true`，并告知此合约正在实现 ERC-721 接口。

#### \(2\) `function balanceOf(address owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);`<a id="2-function-balanceof-address-owner-public-view-returns-uint256-balance"></a>

balanceOf "是ERC-721的强制方法。 `balanceOf` 返回 `owner` 账户中的 NFT 数量。

```text
    function balanceOf(address owner) public view returns (uint256) {
        require(owner != address(0), "ERC721: balance query for the zero address");

        return _ownedTokensCount[owner].current();
    }
```

`balanceOf` 只是从 `owner` 在 `ownedTokensCount` 中维护的 `Counter` 对象中返回当前计数。

```text
    // Mapping from owner to number of owned token
    mapping (address => Counters.Counter) private _ownedTokensCount;
```

#### \(3\) `safeTransferFrom` 和 `transferFrom`<a id="3-safetransferfrom-and-transferfrom"></a>

这些函数将给定令牌 ID 的所有权转移到另一个地址。 ERC-721要求使用两种 "safeTransferFrom "方法，一种包含 "数据"，另一种不包含 "数据"。 除了不带 `data` 的方法只是将 `data` 设为 `""`，这两种方法的工作原理完全相同。 `safeTransferFrom` 在调用 `transferFrom` 时会进行更多检查，如下所示，与 `transferFrom` 相比，"safeTransferFrom "更受欢迎，后者也是 ERC-721 的强制方法。

```text
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
        safeTransferFrom(from, to, tokenId, "");
    }

    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory _data) public {
        transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);
        require(_checkOnERC721Received(from, to, tokenId, _data), "ERC721: transfer to non ERC721Receiver implementer");
    }

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public {
        //solhint-disable-next-line max-line-length
        require(_isApprovedOrOwner(msg.sender, tokenId), "ERC721: transfer caller is not owner nor approved");

        _transferFrom(from, to, tokenId);
    }
```

`safeTransferFrom` 检查 `to` 地址是否能接收令牌。 `_checkOnERC721Received` 具有验证逻辑。 如果 `to` 地址是一个合约，则该合约应实现 ERC-721 的 `onERC721Received` 接口，并返回正确的 4 字节哈希值以接收 ERC-721 令牌，如下所示。

```text
    function _checkOnERC721Received(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory _data)
        internal returns (bool)
    {
        if (!to.isContract()) {
            return true;
        }

        bytes4 retval = IERC721Receiver(to).onERC721Received(msg.sender, from, tokenId, _data);
        return (retval == _ERC721_RECEIVED);
    }
```

transferFrom "实际上是转移给定 "tokenId "的所有权，如下所示。

```text
    function _transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal {
        require(ownerOf(tokenId) == from, "ERC721: transfer of token that is not own");
        require(to != address(0), "ERC721: transfer to the zero address");

        _clearApproval(tokenId);

        _ownedTokensCount[from].decrement();
        _ownedTokensCount[to].increment();

        _tokenOwner[tokenId] = to;

        emit Transfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }
```

#### \(4\) `function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal`.<a id="4-function-_mint-address-to-uint256-tokenid-internal"></a>

`_mint` 不是 ERC-721 的一部分。 不过，我们需要一种方法来创建新的 ERC-721 令牌，并在此实现中引入了 `_mint` 来创建新令牌，如下所示。

```text
    function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal {
        require(to != address(0), "ERC721: mint to the zero address");
        require(!_exists(tokenId), "ERC721: token already minted");

        _tokenOwner[tokenId] = to;
        _ownedTokensCount[to].increment();

        emit Transfer(address(0), to, tokenId);
    }
```

`_mint` 是一个内部方法，可在本合同内部调用。 在`MyERC721Card.sol`中，`_mint`仅从`MyERC721Card`合约中的`mintCard`方法调用。 只有智能合约的所有者才能调用 "mintCard"。

```text
    function mintCard(string name, address account) public {
        require(owner == msg.sender); // Only the Owner can create Items
        uint256 cardId = cards.length; // Unique card ID
        cards.push(Card(name, 1));
        _mint(account, cardId); // Mint a new card
    }
```

## 2. 部署智能合约

你可以使用 Remix Online IDE 或使用 truffle 来部署上述 `MyERC721Card` 智能合约。

### 2.1 使用 Remix 在线 IDE 部署智能合约<a id="2-1-deploying-smart-contract-using-kaia-ide"></a>

- 请访问 [Kaia Plugin for Remix](https://ide.kaia.io) 并创建 "MyERC721Card "合同。 完整源代码见 [Writing ERC-721 Smart Contract](#1-writing-erc-721-smart-contract)。
- 创建一个账户来部署合同。
 - 如果您还没有账户，请在 [https://toolkit.kaia.io/account/accountKeyLegacy](https://toolkit.kaia.io/account/accountKeyLegacy) 上创建一个账户。
 - 从水龙头获取一些测试 KAIA - [https://faucet.kaia.io](https://faucet.kaia.io)
- 让我们如下部署 `MyERC721Card.sol`。

![ERC721-1-deploy](/img/build/smart-contracts/erc721-1-deploy.png)

现在，`MyERC721Card` 已上线！ 您可以铸造和转移与 ERC-721 兼容的非赝品代币卡。

让我们为账户 "0x2645BA5Be42FeEe907ca8e9d88f6Ee6dAd8c1410 "铸造两张卡片，即 "国王 "卡和 "王后 "卡，如下所示。

![ERC721-2-mint-king](/img/build/smart-contracts/erc721-2-mint-king.png) ![ERC721-3-mint-queen](/img/build/smart-contracts/erc721-3-mint-queen.png)

现在我们已经铸造了两张卡片，让我们检查一下这些 `MyERC721Card` 不可篡改令牌的状态。

![ERC721-4-cards-status](/img/build/smart-contracts/erc721-4-cards-status.png)

- balanceOf`显示账户`0x2645BA5Be42FfEe907ca8e9d88f6Ee6dAd8c1410\` 有两张卡。
- 参数为 `1` 的 `cards` 显示令牌 ID 为 `1` 的 `MyERC721Card` 是 1 级的 `Queen` 。
- 参数 `0` 的 `ownerOf` 显示令牌 ID `0` 的 `MyERC721Card` 的所有者是 `0x2645BA5Be42FfEe907ca8e9d88f6Ee6dAd8c1410`。
